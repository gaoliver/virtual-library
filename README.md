# Virtial Library App

This is a mobile application built using React Native, Redux (RTK), and TypeScript. The app allows users to search for books using the Open Library API, view search results, and manage their wish list and currently reading group. The app is designed to showcase my skills in React Native development, Redux state management, and UI/UX design.
